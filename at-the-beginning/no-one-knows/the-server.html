  <h2 data-section="1.2_">Professional Interest</h2>
  <p>
    I have a deeply interest for the new paradigma offered by Web 4.0, which
    proposes a new model of interaction with the user that is more complete and
    personalized.
  </p>
  <p>
    I am a fervent follower of

    >
    due to the innumerable advantages offered by them.
  </p>
  <p>
    I am passionate about the idea of fusing the sensitive imagery of design and
    the logical reasoning of programming because it allows the creation of
    highly efficient and aesthetically appropriate objects.

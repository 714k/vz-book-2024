Dunc the Lunk, thick as a castle wall. A forked purple lightning bolt, on black field speckled with four-pointed stars. Our Sun Shines Bright. I would like a trial by combat. The Dothraki do things in their own time, for their own reasons. More pigeon pie, please. And now his watch is ended. House Tarly of Horn Hill The North remembers. Words are like wind. The battle of the redgrass field. Never Resting. Bastards are born of passion, aren't they? We don't despise them in Dorne. The bear and the maiden fair. Winter is coming.
